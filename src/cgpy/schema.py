"""The engine wire vocabulary — a DLL-free twin of `src/cg/api.py`'s IntEnums (ADR-0059).

cgpy renders observations with these int values; they are the agent-facing parity contract.
Values are copied verbatim from `src/cg/api.py` (which loads the DLL at import time and
therefore must not be imported here). The competition warns new members may be appended
mid-competition — `tools/parity/extract_dsl.py --check` plus the parity gate surface that.
